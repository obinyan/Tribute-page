                        The curriculum for Design and Technology in secondary schools 
                        England and Wales has been under review. With policy makers 
                        questioning not only the position the subject occupies within 
                        the curriculum but also the value Design and Technologies holds. 
                        As a result, Design and Technologies future, as a subject, 
                        is uncertain. Set against a background of policy and 
                        curriculum change, this paper presents the findings of a research 
                        study designed to elicit the perceptions and gain an insight into 
                        the way key stage 3 pupils (11-14 years) view Design and Technology. 
                        Utilizing the concept of the original PATT tools and building upon 
                        the work of previous studies undertaken nationally or globally, 
                        the fundamental aim of the research at inception was to investigate 
                        the perceptions of pupils with respect to their understanding of 
                        what is technology education. Although simplistic in origin, the 
                        findings presented illustrate that this is far from the case. 
                        Framed epistemologically within a social practice lens, the research 
                        tools used was a questionnaire
